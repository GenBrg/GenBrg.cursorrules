# Lessons

- For website image paths, always use the correct relative path (e.g., 'images/filename.png') and ensure the images directory exists
- For search results, ensure proper handling of different character encodings (UTF-8) for international queries
- Add debug information to stderr while keeping the main output clean in stdout for better pipeline integration
- When using seaborn styles in matplotlib, use 'seaborn-v0_8' instead of 'seaborn' as the style name due to recent seaborn version changes
- When using Jest, a test suite can fail even if all individual tests pass, typically due to issues in suite-level setup code or lifecycle hooks

## Current Task: Update and Test LLM API with g4f

Task: Update LLM API implementation to use g4f with automatic provider selection and gpt-4o as default model

### Requirements Analysis:
- Remove provider selection from llm_api.py
- Set gpt-4o as default model
- Update tests to reflect changes
- Update documentation in .cursorrules
- Add enhanced logging and debugging output

### Implementation Plan:
[X] Update llm_api.py
  - Remove provider selection
  - Set gpt-4o as default model
  - Keep image support
  - Update error handling and logging
  - Add detailed logging for debugging

[X] Update test_llm_api.py
  - Remove provider-related tests
  - Add model-specific tests
  - Update existing tests for new defaults
  - Add comprehensive logging

[X] Update Documentation
  - Update .cursorrules with new API usage
  - Document available models
  - Clarify automatic provider selection

[X] Enhanced Logging Implementation
  - Added detailed logging in main API
  - Added test-specific logging
  - Added response previews
  - Added timing information

### Testing Results:
1. Unit Tests (All Passed):
   - test_encode_image_to_base64
   - test_query_llm_basic
   - test_query_llm_with_image
   - test_query_llm_with_custom_model
   - test_query_llm_with_nonexistent_image
   - test_query_llm_error_handling

2. Live Testing Results:
   - Successfully tested with gpt-4o model
     * Quick response time (~11 seconds)
     * Accurate response for simple math
   - Successfully tested with gpt-3.5-turbo model
     * Faster response time (~5 seconds)
     * Detailed response for philosophical question
   - Logging system working as expected
     * Shows full request/response cycle
     * Includes timing information
     * Provides response previews
     * Proper error handling visible

### Notes:
- Provider selection is now fully automatic
- Default model is gpt-4o
- All tests passing successfully
- Documentation updated to reflect changes
- Enhanced logging provides better debugging capabilities
- Different models show different response characteristics

### Lessons Learned:
- g4f provides extensive model support
- Automatic provider selection simplifies usage
- Default model helps ensure consistent results
- Comprehensive logging is essential for debugging
- Different models have different response times and styles

### Current Implementation Status
Implementation, testing, and documentation updates completed successfully with enhanced logging and debugging capabilities.
